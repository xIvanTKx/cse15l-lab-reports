1. Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
2. Share an example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
3. Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.

> Using cd with no argument would change our current directory to home, no matter what the previous working directory was. There is no output in the terminal except for the change in the present working directory.

> Using cd with a path to a directory as an argument would allow us to change our current working directory if the specified path and directory exist. Again, there is no output in the terminal except for the change in the present working directory.

> Using cd with a path to a file as an argument would output an error message because a file is not a directory. Thus, changing our current working directory to a *file* is not realistic.
